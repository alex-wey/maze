Instructions for use:
-
To generate a maze, type into terminal "./generator" followed by the name of the output file, the number of rows desired, and the number of columns desired.

There are two choices of solution for that maze. If the user wants the exact path from the starting points to the goal points, the PRUNED path, then type into terminal "./solver" followed by the name of the maze file, the number of rows in the maze, the number of columns in the maze, the path file, the starting row, the starting column, the goal row, and the goal column.

If the user wants the entire path that the solver took to search the maze, the FULL, then type into terminal "./solver_full" and the other following arguments for the previous solution.
